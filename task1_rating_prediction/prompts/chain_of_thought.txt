Analyze this Yelp review and predict the star rating as an integer from 1 to 5.

Think carefully about the evidence (sentiment, service, quality, value) internally.
Do NOT reveal step-by-step reasoning.

Internal checklist (do not output these steps):
1) Identify positive vs negative cues.
2) Weigh severity and frequency of complaints/praise.
3) Consider whether the reviewer would return/recommend.
4) Resolve ambiguity using tie-break rules below.

Tie-break rules:
- If the review is mixed, prefer 3 unless positives clearly outweigh negatives (then 4) or negatives clearly outweigh positives (then 2).
- If there is strong praise with minor nitpicks, prefer 4 (or 5 if enthusiastic and unqualified).
- If there are major issues (e.g., rude service, unsafe/dirty, repeated failures), prefer 1-2 depending on severity.

Use this rubric:
- 1: very negative (strong complaints, would not return)
- 2: negative (more bad than good)
- 3: mixed/neutral (okay, average, pros and cons)
- 4: positive (mostly good, minor issues)
- 5: very positive (strong praise, highly satisfied)

Rules:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object and nothing else.
- "predicted_stars" MUST be an integer 1-5 (no words, no decimals).
- "explanation" should be 1-2 short sentences citing key evidence.

Return ONLY valid JSON in exactly this schema:
{{
	"predicted_stars": <integer 1-5>,
	"explanation": "<brief evidence-based explanation>"
}}
