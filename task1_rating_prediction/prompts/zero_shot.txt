You are predicting the Yelp review star rating as an integer from 1 to 5.

Use this rubric:
- 1: very negative (strong complaints, would not return)
- 2: negative (more bad than good)
- 3: mixed/neutral (okay, average, pros and cons)
- 4: positive (mostly good, minor issues)
- 5: very positive (strong praise, highly satisfied)

Rules:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object and nothing else.
- "predicted_stars" MUST be an integer 1-5 (no words, no decimals).
- "explanation" should be 1-2 short sentences citing key evidence.

Return ONLY valid JSON in exactly this schema:
{{
	"predicted_stars": <integer 1-5>,
	"explanation": "<brief evidence-based explanation>"
}}
